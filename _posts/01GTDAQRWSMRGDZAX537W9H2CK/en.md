## Wontan soy sauce ramen

![ワンタン醤油ラーメン](/assets/blog/01GTDAQRWSMRGDZAX537W9H2CK/cover.jpg)

## Impressions

When you take a sip of the soup, the returning soy sauce spreads softly, followed by the aroma of _dashi_.
The soup was quite tasty.
The simple ingredients - seasoned bamboo shoots, green onion and chashu pork - are also well put together.

The wontons were plump and juicy and matched the soy sauce perfectly.

I would like to go back as it is close to my house.
The downside is that the queue are a bit long.
